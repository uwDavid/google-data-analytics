# Week 1 - Intro To Capstone

## Portfolio Checklist

-   **Biography**: The main focus of your portfolio is to introduce yourself in a strong and memorable way. Write a concise and clear introduction of yourself. The goal is to capture your audience’s interest and compel them to want to meet you to learn more.

-   **Contact page**: Be sure to include a way for others to get in touch with you, whether it be via email, phone call (if you are comfortable), or social media handles (especially LinkedIn). You might find that your website has its own built-in contact form if you use common website builders.

-   **Resume**: In previous readings, Adding Professional Skills to your Resume and Adding Soft Skills to your Resume, you learned how to craft a resume that reflects your skills and your experience. Be sure to include a resume somewhere in your portfolio.

-   **Accomplishments**: You are not just limited to your past experiences. Any present career-worthy highlights you can think of should be included. This can be any certifications you have earned, data analytics events you have attended, or even blog posts you have published.

-   An image of you (optional): Add a personal touch with your photo. All you need is a simple, clear photo that represents you well.

## Case Study Checklist

-   **Introduction**: Make sure to state the purpose of the case study. This includes what the scenario is and an explanation on how it relates to a real-world obstacle. Feel free to note any assumptions or theories you might have depending on the information provided.
-   **Problems**: You need to identify what the major problems are, explain how you have analyzed the problem, and present any facts you are using to support your findings.
-   **Solutions**: Outline a solution that would alleviate the problem and have a few alternatives in mind to show that you have given the case study considerable thought. Don’t forget to include pros and cons for each solution.
-   **Conclusion**: End your presentation by summarizing key takeaways of all of the problem-solving you conducted, highlighting what you have learned from this.
-   **Next steps**: Choose the best solution and propose recommendations for the client or business to take. Explain why you made your choice and how this will affect the scenario in a positive way. Be specific and include what needs to be done, who should enforce it, and when.
